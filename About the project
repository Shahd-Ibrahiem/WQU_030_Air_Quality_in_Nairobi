In this project, we'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. We'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time seriesmodel to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Some of the things we'll learn in this project are:

1.How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
2.How to prepare time series data for analysis.
3.How to build an autoregression model.
4.How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
